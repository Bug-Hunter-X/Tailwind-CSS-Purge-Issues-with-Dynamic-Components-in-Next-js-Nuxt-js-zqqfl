This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when a component is dynamically rendered, but Tailwind's purge functionality doesn't correctly identify and include the necessary CSS classes. This leads to missing styles in the dynamically rendered component.  For instance, if a component renders a button with the class `bg-blue-500`, the button might appear without any background color because `bg-blue-500` wasn't included in the final CSS output.  The problem is often exacerbated when using server-side rendering (SSR).
